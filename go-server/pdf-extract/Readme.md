To read from a PDF and create a new PDF in Go, you can use libraries like github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu and github.com/jung-kurt/gofpdf.

Here is an example of how to read from an existing PDF and create a new PDF:
Prerequisites

    Install pdfcpu and gofpdf:
```

    go get github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu
    go get github.com/jung-kurt/gofpdf
```
Reading from a PDF

Using pdfcpu, you can extract text from a PDF.


Explanation:

    Reading PDF:
        The api.ExtractTextFile function from pdfcpu extracts the text content from the provided PDF file.
    Creating PDF:
        A new PDF is created using gofpdf. The extracted text content is written into this new PDF using the MultiCell method, which allows for multiple lines of text.
    Error Handling:
        Proper error handling is implemented to catch any issues during the reading and writing processes.

This example covers reading a PDF, extracting its text content, and then creating a new PDF with that extracted text. You can further customize the PDF creation process by adding more pages, formatting text, and including other elements like images and tables using gofpdf.
